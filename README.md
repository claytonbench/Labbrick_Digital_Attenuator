# Labbrick_Digital_Attenuator
Linux USB Driver and Control Tool to use the digital attenuator from Labbrick.

This is a small tool to use the LabBrick Digital Atenuator from Vaunix and it
is tested and validated with the USB LDA-602 attenuator.

As the Code of Vaunix is not open source it will not be included in this
repository so that everyone who wishes to use this program needs to download
their source and include it into the folder.
